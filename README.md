Overview:
The project aims to develop an e-commerce website that leverages offline storage mechanisms, utilizing Session Storage for login information, Local Storage for user registration details, and IndexedDB for storing product information. This approach ensures a seamless and responsive user experience by optimizing data storage and retrieval while maintaining security and reliability.

Features:
User Authentication and Session Storage: Implement secure user login functionalities and store session-specific information (like login tokens or user-specific data) using Session Storage for quick access during the user's session.
User Registration and Local Storage: Store user registration details securely using Local Storage to retain persistent information such as user preferences, profile details, or shopping cart items.
Product Management with IndexedDB: Utilize IndexedDB to manage and store product information, including details like product descriptions, images, pricing, and inventory.
Offline Capabilities: Implement offline capabilities to enable users to browse previously accessed pages and view product information even without an internet connection.
Data Synchronization: Implement mechanisms for data synchronization between offline storage and the server when the internet connection is restored to ensure data consistency.
Technologies Used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Frontend technologies for building the website's user interface and interactivity.
IndexedDB API: Leveraging the browser-based database for storing large amounts of structured data (like product information).
Session Storage and Local Storage: Utilizing browser storage mechanisms for session-specific and persistent data storage, respectively.
Backend Technologies: Specify the backend technologies for user authentication, registration, and managing product data (could include Node.js, ASP.NET, PHP, etc.).
Offline Storage Best Practices: Implementing best practices for offline storage and synchronization to ensure data integrity.
Expected Outcomes:
A fully functional e-commerce website enabling users to log in securely, register, browse products, and make purchases.
Demonstrable use of Session Storage, Local Storage, and IndexedDB for storing and retrieving different types of data.
Enhanced user experience through offline capabilities and efficient data storage mechanisms.
Comprehensive documentation outlining storage strategies, implementation details, and synchronization mechanisms.
